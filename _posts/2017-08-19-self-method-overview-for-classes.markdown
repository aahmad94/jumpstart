<h4>Weâ€™ll explore a few simple rules that will clarify both the definition and the relationship of self in the context of its use in ruby classes.</h4>
<h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Use self when setting/getting instance attributes inside a class definition.</li>
    <li>Use self to denote a method within the class definition as a class method.</li>
    <li>Use self to reference the calling object within an instance method definition.</li>
  </ol>
</h3>
